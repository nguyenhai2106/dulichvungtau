                <h5 id="content__item-1">Basic requirements</h5>
                <p>To help create comfortable, reliable stays for guests, all homes and hosts must meet four basic requirements.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-2">Getting great reviews from guests</h5>
                <p>We’ve found that hosts who get great reviews tend to focus on five things: cleanliness, essential amenities, accurate listing details, a smooth check-in, and proactive communication.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-3">Cleanliness</h5>
                <p>Guests will expect the clean and tidy space they see in your listing photos. Make sure you give yourself enough time to clean between guests, especially when you have back-to-back bookings. Guests will have the opportunity to rate the
                    cleanliness of your space, and the average of your ratings will appear on your listing page. If you consistently receive low cleanliness ratings, you may be subject to penalties.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-4">Essential amenities</h5>
                <p>We recommend all hosts provide the essential amenities so guests have what they need to be comfortable and have a good night’s rest.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-5">Accurate listing details</h5>
                <p>Setting the right expectations before a trip can contribute to a better experience for both you and your guests. You can help travelers decide if your space meets their needs by providing clear info and must-know details like whether you
                    allow pets. A detailed listing and profile helps attract the guests who are looking for a place just like yours. Guests will have the opportunity to rate the accuracy of the information you provide.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-6">Easy check-in</h5>
                <p>A clear and simple check-in process will help put your guests at ease after a day of traveling. Guests will be asked to rate their check-in experience at the end of their stay.</p>
                <h5 id="content__item-7">Supporting guests during their stay</h5>
                <p>Whether or not you’re staying in the space with your guests, it’s important to remain available throughout their stay. Your guests will have the opportunity to rate the clarity and consistency of your communication at the end of their
                    stay—and the average of these guest ratings will appear on your listing page.</p>
